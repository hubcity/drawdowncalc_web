## 2024-03-02 - [Parent-driven State Causing Form Re-renders]
**Learning:** [A common pattern in React is having a parent component track form state (e.g., "is form edited?") while rendering a complex form component. Updating this parent state on every keystroke can cause the parent, and subsequently the entire form, to re-render unnecessarily, degrading performance significantly if the form is large or complex.]
**Action:** [When passing callbacks to child components that update parent state (like `onFormEdit`), wrap the callback in `useCallback` to provide a stable reference. Then, wrap the complex child component (like `DrawdownPlanForm`) in `React.memo()`. Also ensure any internal functions passed as props to lower-level components inside the memoized child (e.g. `handleInputChange`) are also wrapped in `useCallback`.]
